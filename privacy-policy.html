        <h2>Collecting and Using Your Data</h2>
        <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
        <h4>Personal Data</h4>
        <p>Our Service is designed to be used without requiring any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number. We do not ask for, collect, or store this type of Personal Data.</p>
        
        <h4>Usage Data</h4>
        <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service for essential operations. This may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address) and unique device identifiers, which are necessary for establishing a peer-to-peer connection.</p>
        
        <h4>Information Collected while Using the Application</h4>
        <p>While using Our Application, features such as location sharing or accessing your camera and photo library operate strictly on a peer-to-peer basis. This information is end-to-end encrypted and is <strong>never uploaded to or stored on any Company servers or Service Provider servers</strong>. It is only stored locally on Your device and the device of the person you are communicating with.</p>
        
        <h3>Use of Your Data</h3>
        <p>We use the limited Usage Data (such as IP addresses during the connection process via our Service Providers) for the sole purpose of providing and maintaining our peer-to-peer communication Service.</p>

        <h3>Sharing of Your Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party Service Providers to facilitate our Service. These providers are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used exclusively for the 'signaling' process, which is required to establish a direct, peer-to-peer connection between users. This service may have access to a user's IP address for the sole purpose of facilitating this connection. For more information, you can review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Xirsys:</strong> Used to provide TURN server capabilities. In situations where a direct peer-to-peer connection cannot be established, Xirsys acts as a relay for the encrypted communication data between users. This means that a user's IP address and the encrypted data stream will pass through Xirsys's servers. For more information, you can review the <a href="https://www.xirsys.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xirsys Privacy Policy</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not share any personal information other than what is necessary for these services to function.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>With other users:</strong> When You share information or communicate with other users, that information is sent directly to them via the peer-to-peer connection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retention and Deletion of Your Data</h3>
        <p>We do not retain any Personal Data or Usage Data on any servers, as our Service is serverless. All communication data is stored exclusively on the user's own device. As We do not collect or store your Personal Data, there is no information for Us to delete. You have full control to delete information and conversations from within the Application on Your own device.</p>

        <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, We may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>

        <h2>Security of Your Data</h2>
        <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us. All communication through our Service is protected with strong, end-to-end encryption. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us, such as the links to our Service Providers' policies. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
